# So you want to create a new sprint landing page?


## Process

1. Duplicate "template.html" and fill in all the places where there is a "TODO".
2. Duplicate "template.js" and follow the instructions. This will instruct you to create new Google sheets, update their settings, and update some settings.
3. Duplicate "template.css" and find and replace the colors you want to edit, to customize the skin for the landing page.

##Good luck!


###With love,
